#### DataSet description
Mainly use four csv datasets of Statistical Area 2 (SA2), provided by Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS)

### Google Map API 
- The boundary of the neighbourhoods is added as an extra column in the neighbourhoods dataset
- Add longitude and latitude for each records in dataset. [NoteBook](../master/notebook/MajorCode/New_neighbourhood_goolgeMapAPI.ipynb)

### Precise spatial join with neighbourhood 
Performing the precise spatial join with Sydney2_2016_AUST.shp, to add an extra column called area_id where car pods are located in. [NoteBook](../master/notebook/MajorCode/Spatial_Join.ipynb)
