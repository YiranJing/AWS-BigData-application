# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. (Data resource from Kaggle) [Telco Customer Churn Data](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/kernels)

## AWS S3 Storage
- I show the example that how to read in and write out data using **S3 buckets** and the proper way to creat data files in S3 [My SageMaker Notes](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_SageMaker_CustomerChurn/SageMakerNotes/TrainDeployBuildinModel.pdf)

## AWS Machine Learning: Amazon SageMaker
### Part 1: Data Cheaning and Analysis
- My way of data cleaning ang data engineering with plot visualization, differ from the Kaggle open resources. Details see: [Data analysis with modelling Notebook](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_SageMaker_CustomerChurn/notebook/ChurnDataAnalysis/Churn_Example.ipynb)

### Part 2: Trian and deploy ML model using batch transformation and hosting service
- The example that how to use **Amazon sageMaker buildin ML model** to train, deploy and validate GXBoost model using **Batch Transformation** for Telecom Customer Churn. Details see: [BuildIn XGBoost Amazon SageMaker Notebook](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_SageMaker_CustomerChurn/notebook/AmazonSageMaker/AWS_BUILTIN_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT.ipynb)
- The example of deploying and validating GXBoost model using **hosting services**
### Part 3: Trian and deploy customised ML model
- The example that how to **create customised ML model used in Amazon sageMaker** using use **Lambda functions** to run batch transform jobs and to clean the data. Details see: [Customised XGBoost Amazon SageMaker Notebook](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_SageMaker_CustomerChurn/notebook/AmazonSageMaker/AWS_CUSTOMISED_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT.ipynb)

## AWS Machine Learning: Amazon Forecast
Time series forecasting combining related data and ML models.

## Amazon Compute: AWS Lambda
### Part 1: AWS Lambda Functions on S3 Event Triggers invoking (ML model) endpoint 
Using the built XGBoost endpoint from [Amazon Sagemaker of Customer Churn](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/tree/master/AWS_SageMaker_CustomerChurn/notebook/AmazonSageMaker). You can find [Notes](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_lambda_CustomerChurn/Lambda_Function_Notes.pdf) here. And the [source code](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/tree/master/AWS_lambda_CustomerChurn/MyFirstFunction)
### Part 2: Clean data within AWS Lambda Function
Install and using Pandas and Numpy in AWS Lambda execution environment.
