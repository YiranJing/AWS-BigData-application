Modeling, Deploying, and Forecasting using Amazon forecast console.
New APIs after 7/23/19. New Featuers:
1. Forecast dimensions - Selective keys to generate forecasting. (Item_id by default: the only choice in old version).
2. Country for holidays - the holoday calendar want to include in models.
3. Number of backtest windows - The number of times that the algorithm splits the input data for use in training and evaluation. **Backtesting**: Backtesting assesses the viability of a model by discovering how it would play out using historical data. Backtesting can be an important step in optimizing your trading strategy.
4. Backetest window offset - The point in the dataset where you want to splitmthe data for model training and validation
5. Training subsample ratio(between 0 and 1): The percentage of items as the training data. 



### DeepAR+ Recipe [details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/aws-forecast-recipe-deeparplus.html#aws-forecast-recipe-deeparplus-how-it-works)
Amazon Forecast DeepAR+ is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar (one-dimensional) time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Classical forecasting methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or exponential smoothing (ETS), fit a single model to each individual time series, and then use that model to extrapolate the time series into the future. 
A DeepAR+ model is trained by randomly sampling several training examples from each of the time series in the training dataset. Each training example consists of a pair of adjacent context and prediction windows with fixed predefined lengths.
#### Advantage of DeepAR+ algo
1. (Main motivation)When your dataset contains hundreds of feature time series, the **DeepAR+ recipe outperforms the standard ARIMA and ETS methods**. (Standard forecasting algorithms, such as ARIMA or ETS, might provide more accurate results on a single time series.)
2. Each target time series can also be associated with a number of categorical features, since you can combine muptiple related time series data to it. 
3. The target time series might contain missing values(break point). DeepAR+ supports only feature time series that are known in the future. This allows you to run counterfactual "what-if" scenarios.
4. Good for learning time-dependent patterns, such as spikes during weekends, as DeepAR+ automatically creates feature time series based on time-series granularity.
5. No stationary process before: To capture seasonality patterns, DeepAR+ also automatically feeds lagged (past period) values from the target time series. 

### Amazon SageMaker DeepAR [AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/now-available-in-amazon-sagemaker-deepar-algorithm-for-more-accurate-time-series-forecasting/)
The Amazon Forecast DeepAR+ algorithm improves upon the Amazon SageMaker DeepAR algorithm with the following new features:
1. Learning rate scheduling
2. Model averaging
3. Weighted sampling
- [Univarate DeepAR+ Notebook](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_Forecast_GolfwithWeather/notebook/Univariate_DeepAR_Train_Deploy_Validation.ipynb) Target time series data only
- [Bivariate DeepAR+ Notebook](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_Forecast_GolfwithWeather/notebook/Bivariate_DeepAR_Train_Deploy_Validation.ipynb)  Target time series and one related time series data
- [Multivarate DeepAR+ Notebook](https://github.com/YiranJing/BigDataAnalysis/blob/master/AWS_Forecast_GolfwithWeather/notebook/Multivariate_DeepAR_Train_Deploy_Validation.ipynb) Target time series and five related time series data
##### Process:
- Create input data(Json format), can combine muptiple realated time series data.
- Train and Deploy model
- Validation: MAPE and plot visualization.
